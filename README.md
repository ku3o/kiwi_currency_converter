# Hi everyone, who is so blessed to read my code! GLHF
#


#
# Pros
#
1. On the fly data
2. None hardcoded data

#
# Cons
#
1. If cache DB is empty, will some response time degradation
2. If some of 2 source service die, it will break for pieces

#
# Some "nice-to-have"
#
1. Support of different source
2. Much more testing, I wrote it after work, so my morality was in very low level :D

#
# P.S.
#
# I don't like PEP-8 standard, I love my style :)
